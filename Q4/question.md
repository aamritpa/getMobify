# Question 4 (12 points)

Write a program which produces a picture of a bridge as output, using multiple languages. The output should be capable of being opened in a web browser (e.g. .gif, .jpg, .png, .svg) and under 20 MB, and the program should run in under 30 seconds.

Additional points will be awarded for programs that are generative, which is to say the produced image depends on input parameters to the program or Randomness.
